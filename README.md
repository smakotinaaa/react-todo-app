in a user-friendly interface.

git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd react-to-do-app

3. Install the dependencies:

npm install

### **Usage**

4. Start the development server:

npm start

5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

6. Start adding and managing your to-do items!

### **Technologies Used**

* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application.
* HTML: Hypertext Markup Language for creating the structure of the application.
* Local Storage: The browser's storage mechanism used for persisting data.
